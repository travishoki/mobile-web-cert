    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <p>Developers typically work in highly iterative deployment environments, relying on extensive testing and debugging to maintain functionality and code integrity. You'll be asked to show that you can verify expected behaviors and diagnose common web application bugs by:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Writing unit tests that first verify a functionâ€™s intended behavior, and then iteratively modifying its code until it passes those tests</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Setting breakpoints within a complicated function to determine exactly where it deviates from expected behavior</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Using console logs to output relevant debugging information</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Reproducing and fixing bugs based on user reported issues</a></li>
    </ul>
